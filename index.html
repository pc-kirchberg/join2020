			<!-- Application Process -->
			<article id="process">
				<h2 class="major">Application Process</h2>

				<!--p>Joining the Pupils’ Committee happens in two phases: the general elections and the internal elections. At the general election, the Class Representatives vote on whether they want you in the Pupils’ Committee (without a specific position in
					mind, except Leisure positions), while at the internal election the other newly elected members vote on your position.</p>
				<p><b>Note: candidates for the Leisure Subcommittee are elected directly onto the PC, bypassing the internal elections. However, it is at the internal elections where the Head of Leisure is elected.</b></p>
				<p>First, you must apply on this website. As part of the application form, you will be asked to choose which position you would go for, and which would be your backup should you not get the first. If you want to run for Leisure Subcommittee, the
					choice is final at this stage, otherwise you can still reconsider later on.</p>
				<p>At the general election, you will need to give a speech to all the Class Representatives, explaining who you are, why you want to join the Pupils’ Committee, and why you would be good for your position of choice. There is a time limit of two
					minutes, however experience shows that time shouldn’t be an issue, so we won’t cut you off as soon as you reach the limit; still, try to keep your speech under two minutes. <b>If you are applying for the Leisure Subcommittee as well as a
						non-Leisure position, you get three minutes.</b></p>
				<p>All the class reps will vote on whether they want to see you in the Pupils’ Committee. They will have three options, “Yes”, “Maybe”, or “No”.</p>
				<p>If you are applying for both Leisure Subcommittee and a different position, the class reps can vote for each position separately - they will have two rows for you on their ballot papers.</p>
				<p>After the election, we will count all the votes and send you an email letting you know whether or not you were elected.</p>
				<p>At the internal election, we will go through each position one at a time. The candidates for that position will be asked to give a speech explaining why they’d be good for it. There is no time limit on these speeches. Then, all the candidates
					will be asked to leave the room and the rest of the Committee will vote on the position.</p>
				<p>If you know you can’t make it to the internal election, please let us know as soon as you find out and we’ll try to reschedule it. If we can’t find a date that suits everyone or you are unexpectedly absent, you can give your speech to someone
					else to read out (unless you’re running for President), however if you don’t get the position you were hoping for you will have no other choice but to take what’s left for you.</p-->

				<h3>How do I get elected into the PC?</h3>
				<p>Joining the Pupils’ Committee happens in two phases: the general elections and the internal elections. At the general election, the Class Representatives vote on whether they want you
					in the Pupils’ Committee (without a specific position in mind, except Leisure, IT, and Environmental positions).</p>
				<p>This means all pupils, except for students applying for Leisure Committee, IT, and Environmental Member, will appear as running for "PC Member" on the voting ballot used by the Class 
					Representatives on the day of the general election. Nevertheless, we welcome candidates stating their preferred position in their speech during the general election.</p>
				<p>It is at the Internal Elections, where the newly elected members will vote on the specific positions and all positions will be distributed (for example Treasurer). Only candidates for
					the Leisure Subcommittee, IT, and the Environmental Member are elected directly to the PC, bypassing the internal elections. However, it is at the internal elections where the 
					Head of Leisure is elected. Applying for Presidency is its own procedure prior to the Internal Elections (see below).</p>

				<h3>How do I apply?</h3>
				<p>First, you must apply on this website. As part of the application form, you will be asked to choose which position you want to run for. If you want to run for Leisure Subcommittee, IT, 
					or Environmental Member. the choice is final at this stage, otherwise you can still reconsider later on.</p>

				<h3>What happens during the general election?</h3>
				<p>At the general election, you will need to give a speech to all the Class Representatives, explaining who you are, why you want to join the Pupils’ Committee, and why you would be good
					for your desired position. There is a time limit of two minutes for all candidates, which we ask you to keep in mind when preparing your speech.</p>
				<p>All the Class Representatives will vote on whether they want to see you in the Pupils’ Committee. They will have three options, “Yes”, “Maybe”, or “No”.</p>

				<h3>What happens after the election?</h3>
				<p>After the election, all votes will be counted, and an email will be sent to all candidates in due course informing whether or not they were elected.</p>
				<p>New elected members have to attend both the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Candidates’ Approval (explained in the next section) and the internal elections.</p>
				<p>At the internal election, we will go through each position one at a time. The candidates for that position will be asked to give a speech explaining why they would be suitable for it.
					There is no time limit on these speeches. Then, all the candidates will be asked to leave the room and the rest of the Committee will vote on the position.</p>
				<p>If you know you can’t make it to the internal election, please let us know as soon as you find out and we’ll try to reschedule it. If we can’t find a date that suits everyone or you
					are unexpectedly absent, you can give your speech to someone else to read out (unless you’re running for President or Vice-President), however if you don’t get the position you 
					were hoping for you will have no other choice but to take what’s left for you.</p>

				<h3>How are the President and Vice-Presidents elected and how are the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Candidates chosen?</h3>
				<p>The Presidency consists of three people: the President and two Vice-Presidents. As soon as all votes have been counted, all newly elected PC members will be invited to the 
					“Presidential and Vice-Presidential Candidates’ Approval”, where every member of the newly elected PC has the right to present themselves for the position of President and 
					Vice-President. After all candidates have held a speech to the rest of the PC, the members vote on each candidate on whether they approve them as a potential President or 
					Vice-President of the committee.</p>
				<p>All candidates receiving more than 50% of approval among the Pupils’ Committee members are now official candidates in the Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections in front of the 
					Class Representatives.</p>
				<p>The Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections are held following each other on the same day, however in their own categories. First, all presidential candidates will hold a speech
					in front of the Class Representatives explaining why they are suitable to become the next President of the Pupils’ Committee. Then the Class Representatives proceed to vote for 
					one of the candidates, with the candidate receiving the highest number of votes elected as President. After the presidential candidates have given their speeches and the voting
					ballots have been submitted, the vice-presidential candidates will then give their speeches, and the election will follow the same procedure as for the Presidential Election. 
					In the Vice-Presidential Elections, the Class Representatives are asked to vote for two candidates, as there are two roles to be filled 
					(Vice-President and Associate Vice-President).</p>
				<p>On the same day, the internal elections, where all remaining positions are distributed, will be held, chaired by the newly elected President.</p>
