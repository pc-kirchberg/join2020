			<!-- Application Process -->
			<article id="process">
				<h2 class="major">Application Process</h2>
				<p>Joining the Pupils’ Committee happens in two phases: the general elections and the internal elections. At the general election, the Class Representatives vote on whether they want you in the Pupils’ Committee (without a specific position in
					mind, except Leisure positions), while at the internal election the other newly elected members vote on your position.</p>
				<p><b>Note: candidates for the Leisure Committee are elected directly onto the PC, bypassing the internal elections. However, it is at the internal elections where the Head of Leisure is elected.</b></p>
				<p>First, you must apply on this website. As part of the application form, you will be asked to choose which position you would go for, and which would be your backup should you not get the first. If you want to run for Leisure Committee), the
					choice is final at this stage, otherwise you can still reconsider later on.</p>
				<p>At the general election, you will need to give a speech to all the Class Representatives, explaining who you are, why you want to join the Pupils’ Committee, and why you would be good for your position of choice. There is a time limit of two
					minutes, however experience shows that time shouldn’t be an issue, so we won’t cut you off as soon as you reach the limit; still, try to keep your speech under two minutes. <b>If you are applying for the Leisure Committee as well as a
						non-Leisure position, you get three minutes.</b></p>
				<p>All the class reps will vote on whether they want to see you in the Pupils’ Committee. They will have three options, “Yes”, “Maybe”, or “No”.</p>
				<p>If you are applying for both Leisure Committee and a different position, the class reps can vote for each position separately - they will have two rows for you on their ballot papers.</p>
				<p>After the election, we will count all the votes and send you an email letting you know whether or not you were elected.</p>
				<p>At the internal election, we will go through each position one at a time. The candidates for that position will be asked to give a speech explaining why they’d be good for it. There is no time limit on these speeches. Then, all the candidates
					will be asked to leave the room and the rest of the Committee will vote on the position.</p>
				<p>If you know you can’t make it to the internal election, please let us know as soon as you find out and we’ll try to reschedule it. If we can’t find a date that suits everyone or you are unexpectedly absent, you can give your speech to someone
					else to read out (unless you’re running for President), however if you don’t get the position you were hoping for you will have no other choice but to take what’s left for you.</p>
